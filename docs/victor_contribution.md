## **Víctor Masó contribution**

I am the lead of the team. Overall my main role has been organizing the team and the workflow, make sure everything is delivered on time and resolve team conflicts. Aside from the lead role I've mainly worked on the aristic part of the project:
- I did all the art related to the player Thrall. All animations (idle, walk, attack, dying).
