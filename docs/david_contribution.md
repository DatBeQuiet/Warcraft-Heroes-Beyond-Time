## **David Lozano contribution**

I am the lead artist of the team. Althoug I've been programming during the project, I've mostly being creating new art for the game. Most of the art you see in the game has been done by me and [Víctor Masó](https://softcactusteam.github.io/Warcraft-Heroes-Beyond-Time/victor_contribution).
- I've done the main character of the game, Thrall which was later animated by Víctor.
- I've done the Boss of the game, Gul'dan
- I've done the enemies on the game and some effects for theme.
- I've taken over the visual rework of the items.
- I've made part og the tileset of the map.
- I've also made some sprites that never appeared on the final project, such a new boss and other enemies.
- I've drawn and animated the little animation you see at the begining of the boss fight.
- I've made some effects for the final game. 
- I've been in charge of some sound fx of the game.
- I've also made the introduction video you see at the beginning of the game

Also I've been doing playtests and helping with the design of the game.

Here you can see some of my work I've made during the project.
