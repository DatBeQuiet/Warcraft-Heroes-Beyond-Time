## **Jonathan Molina-Prados contribution**

I am the UI responsible. Overall my main role has been filling holes in the team, in all code-related stuff. 
I have done a lot of different tasks, like:

- Managing the GitHub repository, branches workflow and the Appveyor implementation to automate builds.
- All the audio playing system.
- A fileSystem using PHYSFS library.
- All the GUI module and its workflow, with the fonts system and the fixed labels for evade the blurry.
- DeltaTime calculations and configuration from xml.
- Fixing the Console, its workflow and the commands management.
- Save and Load workflow.
- The collision system, preventing the player to getting stuck in walls while dashing, etc.
- Thrall attacking, receiving damage, charging the skill, dieing, reliving, etc.
- Fixing errors we had with scales and different screen resolutions.
- New Module for printing and ordering sprites, related to their relative position in the world.
- All the camera following and camera culling system.
- Items management.
- Controller support and rebind.
- Continually checking the whole code and fixing stuff, in order to minimize the possible bugs we get, in special the Scene switching workflow, also trying to evade memory leaks.

Along with other members, I've also done playtesting, some design decisions and bug fixing.
