## **Arnau Morgado contribution**

I am the QA leader of the tea,. Overall my roles have been filing holes wherever i was needed and testing 
all the new features. I have done different tasks, like:

- Playtesting.
- Market analysis.
- Archer sprites and its XML for the coders.
- A lot of enemies sprites and its XML that we didn't use.
- Objects' sprites.
- Programming some of the items.
- Filling holes on some tasks.
